modeest
=======

This is the GitHub repository of the R package modeest. 

This package intends to provide estimators of the mode of univariate unimodal 
(and sometimes multimodal) data and values of the modes of usual probability 
distributions. 

Here are some perspectives I would like to develop with the GitHub community: 
  - confidence interval estimation, 
  - new estimators of the mode, 
  - multivariate mode estimation, 
  - mean-shift algorithm and related methods (e.g. mode tree), 
  - multimodality tests, 
  - highest density region estimation and visualization.
